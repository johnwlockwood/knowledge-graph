# Knowledge Graph Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) frontend for the Knowledge Graph visualization application.

## Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to configure environment variables:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your Cloudflare Turnstile site key:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_turnstile_site_key_here
   ```

## Feature Flags

The application supports several feature flags to control functionality:

### Sub-graph Generation Control

**`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION`**
- **Default**: `true` (enabled)
- **Purpose**: Global control for all sub-graph generation functionality
- **Usage**: Set to `false` to completely disable sub-graph generation

```env
# Disable all sub-graph generation
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION=false
```

**`NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS`**
- **Default**: `false` (nested sub-graphs allowed)
- **Purpose**: Prevents creating sub-graphs from graphs that already have a parent
- **Usage**: Set to `true` to limit graph hierarchy to only one level of nesting

```env
# Allow only first-level sub-graphs (no nested sub-graphs)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true
```

### Feature Flag Combinations

| ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION | DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS | Result |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| `true` (default) | `false` (default) | ‚úÖ Full sub-graph functionality with unlimited nesting |
| `true` | `true` | ‚úÖ Sub-graphs allowed only from root-level graphs |
| `false` | `false` | ‚ùå No sub-graph generation allowed |
| `false` | `true` | ‚ùå No sub-graph generation allowed |

### What Gets Disabled

When sub-graph generation is disabled (either globally or for nested graphs):
- ‚ùå Generate preview no longer appears when clicking nodes
- ‚ùå Tooltip no longer shows "üí° Click to generate sub-graph"
- ‚úÖ Navigation to existing child graphs still works (double-click)
- ‚úÖ Navigation to parent graph still works (double-click root nodes)
- ‚úÖ All other functionality remains unchanged

### Deployment Examples

**Vercel/Netlify**: Set environment variables in deployment settings
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true
```

**Docker**: 
```dockerfile
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true
```

**Local Development**: Add to `.env.local`
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true
```

### Usage Examples

**Full sub-graph functionality** (default behavior):
```bash
# No environment variables needed - this is the default
npm run dev
npm run build
```

**Disable all sub-graph generation** (read-only mode):
```bash
# For development
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION=false npm run dev

# For production build
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION=false npm run build
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION=false npm start
```

**Allow only first-level sub-graphs** (prevent deep nesting):
```bash
# For development
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true npm run dev

# For production build
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true npm run build
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true npm start
```

**Combined flags** (both disabled - same as global disable):
```bash
# For development
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION=false NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true npm run dev

# For production
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBGRAPH_GENERATION=false NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true npm run build
```

**Using .env.local for persistent configuration**:
```env
# Add to .env.local file for development
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_turnstile_site_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_NESTED_SUBGRAPHS=true
```

### Getting Cloudflare Turnstile Keys

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to "Turnstile" in the sidebar
3. Create a new site or use an existing one
4. Copy the **Site Key** for the frontend environment variable
5. Copy the **Secret Key** for the backend configuration (see backend README)

For development/testing, you can use the test key: `1x00000000000000000000AA`

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and set up environment variables, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
