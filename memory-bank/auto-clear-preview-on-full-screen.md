Perfect! The fix has been implemented successfully. Here's what this enhancement provides:

  âœ… Generate Preview Auto-Clear on Fullscreen Toggle

  What the Fix Does:

  1. Automatic Cleanup: When entering fullscreen mode, the generate preview immediately disappears
  2. Exit Cleanup: When exiting fullscreen mode, any visible preview is also cleared
  3. Complete State Reset: Clears all preview-related state:
    - selectedNodeLabel (removes the preview overlay)
    - isPreviewExpanded (resets expansion state)
    - pointerPosition (clears positioning data)

  User Experience Benefits:

  - Clean Transitions: Fullscreen mode starts with a clean interface, no leftover UI elements
  - Consistent Behavior: Preview state doesn't persist across view mode changes
  - Reduced Confusion: Users don't see floating preview overlays that might be positioned incorrectly in the new view mode
  - Fresh Context: Each fullscreen session starts without distracting elements

  Technical Implementation:

  - React Effect: Uses useEffect with isFullscreen dependency
  - Immediate Trigger: Runs every time fullscreen state changes (enter or exit)
  - Complete Reset: Clears all three state variables that control the preview display

  This ensures that the generate preview behaves predictably and doesn't interfere with the fullscreen experience, providing a cleaner and more professional user
  interface.
