Perfect! This is a much cleaner solution. Here's what I changed:

  🔧 Problem

  The error occurred because we were trying to capture the network seed when entering fullscreen mode, but the network wasn't in the right state to provide the
  seed.

  💡 Better Solution

  You're absolutely right - we don't need to get the seed when entering fullscreen mode because:

  1. Normal mode already captures it: When the graph is first loaded in normal mode, the seed is captured during the stabilized event
  2. Seed is stored: The captured seed is stored in layoutSeed prop via onSeedCaptured callback
  3. Fullscreen reuses it: When switching to fullscreen, we can just use the already-stored layoutSeed

  🗑️ What I Removed

  - Problematic seed capture: No more trying to get seed during fullscreen transition
  - Complex timing logic: No delays or multiple checks needed
  - Error-prone getSeed() calls: Eliminated the source of the TypeError

  ✅ What Happens Now

  1. Normal mode: Graph loads → stabilizes → seed captured → stored
  2. Fullscreen mode: Uses the already-stored layoutSeed → no new seed capture needed
  3. Layout consistency: Same seed used in both modes = same layout

  This approach is much more robust and eliminates the console error completely while maintaining the layout persistence feature!
