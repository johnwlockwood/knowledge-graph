Perfect! The visual distinction has been improved. Here's what changed:

  âœ… Improved Visual Distinction for Sub-Graph Nodes

  Changes Made:

  1. New Color Scheme: Changed from blue (#4F46E5) to purple (#7C3AED) for nodes with child graphs
  2. Enhanced Border: Increased border width from 4px to 6px for more prominence
  3. Stronger Shadow: Increased shadow size from 8px to 10px for better depth perception
  4. Updated Legend: Changed the legend indicator to match the new purple color with thicker border

  Visual Hierarchy Now:

  - Purple thick border + large shadow: Nodes with sub-graphs (double-click to navigate to child)
  - Green dashed border + shadow: Root nodes (double-click to navigate to parent)
  - Blue hover effect: Interactive hover state (distinct from sub-graph indicator)
  - Default styling: Regular nodes with no special navigation

  Benefits:

  - Clear Distinction: Purple is visually distinct from the blue hover effects
  - Better Recognition: Thicker border and larger shadow make sub-graph nodes more prominent
  - No Confusion: Users can now easily distinguish between hover states and navigational indicators
  - Consistent Legend: Visual legend accurately represents the new purple styling

  This resolves the confusion between hover states and sub-graph indicators, providing clearer visual feedback for users navigating the connected graph system.
