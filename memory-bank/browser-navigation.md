Perfect! The keyboard shortcuts now properly respect modifier keys. Here's what was implemented:

  Improved Keyboard Navigation ✅

  Modifier Key Support:
  - Plain Arrow Keys: Navigate between graphs in the workspace
    - ← Previous graph
    - → Next graph
  - Cmd+Arrow Keys (Mac) / Ctrl+Arrow Keys (Windows): Browser history navigation
    - Cmd+← / Ctrl+← Browser back
    - Cmd+→ / Ctrl+→ Browser forward

  Implementation Details:

  1. Modifier Key Detection (useKeyboardShortcuts.tsx:18-22):
  if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft' && !e.metaKey && !e.ctrlKey && !e.altKey && !e.shiftKey && onPrevious) {
    - Checks for all modifier keys: metaKey (Cmd), ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey
    - Only captures plain arrow keys without any modifiers
    - Lets browser handle Cmd+arrows for history navigation
  2. User Documentation (GraphNavigation.tsx:129):
    - Updated help text to show both navigation methods
    - Clear distinction between graph navigation and browser history

  Keyboard Behavior:
  - ✅ ← / →: Navigate between graphs in workspace
  - ✅ Cmd+← / Cmd+→: Browser back/forward through hash history
  - ✅ Delete: Remove current graph (unchanged)
  - ✅ Input Field Safety: No shortcuts when typing in inputs
  - ✅ Cross-Platform: Works on both Mac (Cmd) and Windows/Linux (Ctrl)

  User Experience:
  - Natural: Follows standard browser navigation conventions
  - Intuitive: Plain arrows for app navigation, modified arrows for browser
  - Non-conflicting: No interference between app and browser shortcuts
  - Documented: Help text clearly explains both navigation methods

  This creates a much more natural user experience that doesn't conflict with standard browser behavior!
